# App Directory Assets

A collection of design assets to help build an app directory submission.

## App Directory Template

This collection contains template files available for both [Sketch](./sketch) and
[Adobe Photoshop](./photoshop) that can guide the design of images for your Slack app when
submitting to the App Directory. Before you use these templates, make sure you have the necessary
fonts installed. These can be found in the [fonts](./fonts) directory.
